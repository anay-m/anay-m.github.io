Our custom feature is a basketball game. Being avid bball lovers, we've always
enjoyed basketball mini games such as imessage game pigeon, or even mobile games
that we've tried. We thought it would be cool to have an augmented 3d version of 
one of these so we added a basic basketball shooting mode. When the user selects 
this, a 3d basketball hoop is projected into the air (approx. 10ft high) and a ball 
spawns near the player. The player can then move there phone to aim and click a shoot 
button to throw the ball towards the hoop and take a shot! Should the player have an 
accurate shot, collision sensors will indicate that the shot was made and a sound effect 
as well as a notification that you received 5 bucks each time you make a shot! The 
basketball hoop costs 20 dollars to place and you get 10 balls per hop, meaning you 
can make 50 bucks while having spent 20! Woo-hoo!
