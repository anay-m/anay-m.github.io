Our custom object is a group of battle buses from the popular battle royale game "Fortnite".
The secret to entering our custom scene is that for one certain desk, when the player clicks one
it, it dissappears, revealing a hidden hole that leads to a seemingly empty bottom floor. However,
upon jumping down there (our player is too curious for his own good), the evil buses turn on and
roar, charging towards the player. The backwall warns "WATCH OUT" but alas our player has already
sealed their fate. Upon any one of the buses colliding with the player, the game ends, exiting
out of the whole simulation. A terrifying and unfortunate end for our hero.
