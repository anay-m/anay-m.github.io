# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
 I am a CS student at the University of Michigan who is passionate about building scalable tech! Currently looking for opportunities to explore software development and AI-driven fields! Feel free to contact me at [*anaym@umich.edu*](mailto:anaym@umich.edu) if you ever want to chat or build something together!

 Some things I'm building right now ...
 an iOS app called [Nostalgia](https://nostalgia-app.com) and a builder community at [V1 Michigan](https://v1michigan.com/)
