# Augmented Reality - A2 Go

Ann Arbor has declared itself “Tree City USA”, in opposition to the 100+ other cities who claim the same. Help Ann Arbor cement the title by filling the town with unique vegetation using AR, while fighting off Ann arbor squirrels, visiting University of Michigan landmarks, and taking needed breaks for physical activity (AR basketball!!).

Completed for the EECS 498 Augmented Reality course, A2 Go extends the Ann Arbor experience with a fun game full of UMich landmarks, Ann Arbor trees & squirrels (UMich squirrels are pretty famous), and more. Check it out!

## Technologies

We used Unity for the development, Sketchfab for 3D models, Mixamo for character animations, FreeSound for SFX, and Jira for task management. Shoutout to XCode for easily deploying the Iphone App as well!
